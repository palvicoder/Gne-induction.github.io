<p>Today was our first day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College Ludhiana. We started our day by praying at college Gurudwara Sahib.After taking guru ka langar we went to college auditorium. Our Principle sir of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College encouraged us on the first day of our college. Old principal sir of college and many other faculty members motivated us. One of the guest words “no tension and full attention” stuck into my head. Various other alumni also share there experiences with us. We enjoy a lot and gain so much knowledge on our first day of college.</p>
